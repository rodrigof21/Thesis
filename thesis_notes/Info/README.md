## Identification of fractional order systems
---

Systems of the type:

$$
G(s) = \frac{1}{1 + 2\zeta \left( \frac{s}{\omega_n} \right)^\nu + \left( \frac{s}{\omega_n} \right)^{\nu+1}}
\tag{4}
$$

$$
G(s) = \frac{\omega_n^2}{s^{\nu+1} + 2\zeta\omega_n s^\nu + \omega_n^2}
\tag{99}
$$

Each function's target model is identified in the name/documentation
